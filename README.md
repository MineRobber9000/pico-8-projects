# pico-8-projects

Work in progess!

Feel free to use everything as you please. Some creds fould be fun, but not mandatory.
The graphics for Ninja.p8 are all made by me, but are heavily inspired by a game that I cant find out what it is called. I am not sure if it is a commercial game or not. I can't take all the cred though!

Some stuff are more or less done, but I need to sort and clean some stuff.
Will probably create like a WIP folder and have "games" and "tech" as done-folder.
