# pico-8-projects

Work in progess!

Feel free to use everything as you please. Some creds would be fun, but not mandatory.
The graphics for Ninja.p8 are all made by me, but are heavily inspired by a game that I cant find out what it is called. I am not sure if it is a commercial game or not.

Also a good site I would recommend are https://github.com/clowerweb/Lib-Pico8.

I can't take all the cred though!

Some stuff are more or less done, but I need to sort and clean some stuff.
Will probably create like a WIP folder and have "games" and "tech" as done-folder.

# Games

More or less done. Needs a end game. This is the game where I sort of stole graphics from that game that I cant remember the name of. | JetPac is done. It's a clone of the old JetPac that developed for the ZX Spectrum. It was developed for the Banana Jam that Indie Gothenburg hosted. | Scrappy is not even playable. I had an idea, but it sort of spiraled away and became lots of tech demos instead.
